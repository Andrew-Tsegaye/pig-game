# PIG GAME 

![Pig_Game](https://i.imgur.com/KtCKT3u.png)

The game follows the classic rules of Pig, where the objective is to be the first player to reach a score of 100.
Players take turns rolling a pair of dice and accumulating points based on the values rolled. If a player rolls a "1" on either die, their turn ends and they lose all their accumulated points for that turn. However, players can choose to hold their current score and pass the dice to the next player before rolling a "1".
The game has a sleek and easy-to-use interface, with clear instructions and a user-friendly design. Players can customize the game settings, such as the winning score and the number of dice used, to make the game more challenging.

> Overall, the pig game is a great example of a fun and interactive game built with JavaScript. Its clear instructions and user-friendly design make it easy for players to understand and enjoy the game.
